# BABYMETAL | 10 YEARS!
As this year marks the 10 year anniversary of the launch of one my favourite bands, and as they are so unique, I took this opportunity to create a website dedicated to them, to celebrate their 10 years with a brief history, band-member information, images and videos spanning their career to this point and a place where people could find out about upcoming shows and sign-up for more information. 

## User stories

- #### Existing fan visitor goals
    1. As an existing fan of the band, I want to learn more about the band's history and members, so that I will understand where they come from and how they formed.
    2. As an existing fan of the band, I want it to be easy to visit the band's official website and merchandise store to buy their products. I also want to locate their social media links to see their pages.
    3. As an existing fan of the band, I want to see where they are next performing and be able to sign-up for more information

- #### Potential fan visitor goals

    1. As a potential fan of the band, I want to see examples of the band's music and see their pictures over the years, so I can see if I like their music and follow them.
    2. As a potenital fan of the band, I also want to see where they are performing next and sign-up for more information, so that I can go to see one of their shows live.

- #### Site owner goals
    1. As a site owner, I want the band to continue growing in success and therefore want to provide information about them and their upcoming shows to give both existing and potential fans more information about them.
    2. As a site owner, I want the band to sell more of their music and merchandise and advertise their upcoming shows. 
    3. As a site owner, as the band's audience is becoming more global, I wish them wish to reach a wider international fan-base.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are black and dark red, as these are the colours used by the band in their original outifts and many of their promotional pictures. As a band with Metal music as their genre, the background colour had to be dark to be brooding & fit with the band's asthetic, however as this band is also a 'kawaii' band, it is also important to off-set that with the shades of red and the colours in the photographs in the gallery section. The typography throughout the site is white, for best contrast. 
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Nanum Gothic font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Nanum Gothic is easy to read, attractive and appropriate to the band's asthetic. The font colour throughout is white to make it stand-out and for ease of reading against the darker colour scheme.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important for the band and they have alot of images over the 10 years to choose from. The large, background hero image is was chosen as it fits with the colour scheme and it's a very powerful image to catch the user's attention.

## Features

-   Responsive on all device sizes.

-   Interactive elements, such as music videos and a Spotify playlist.

-   Home-page: This page is the landing page when you visit the site, so it needed to be clear about what the website was about and contain information about the band and the band-members. There is a nav-bar and a footer which is the same accross all pages which allows the user to navigate the site easily.

-   Gallery: This page is where users can see an assortment of pictures of the band, from when they were very young until recently. It also contains a select few of their newest and most popular music videos, along with a video at the end that is made by combining all the pro-shots of the band for one of their songs - this one was chosen as it features the Kami band (the musicians) and allows users to see them after a brief explanation of them on the home-page. All images have 'alt text' applied to them so that the pictures can be described to users using screen readers to make the project more inclusive.

-   Upcoming-shows: This page allows the user to see in a simple time-line format the upcoming shows for the band, including the locations and whether it's a festival or part of their own tour. Underneath this is a sign-up form, where the user can choose to submit to receive email updates about the band's performances and can choose their preference for UK only, Global or both, as the band is international and as the list of upcoming shows makes clear they tour all over the world. The sign-up form is coded to produce an error if the required information isnt provided, and shows as a success when all required information is inputted correctly. The fields for typing the email etc have a white border until the mouse hovers over to clearly show the user where to click to move between the fields. Also the sign-up button changes from dark red to white when the mouse moves over, so it is clear that this button should be clicked.

### Future Features
-   An additional feature that might be nice to be implemented in the future is a translation of the lyrics in the songs from the original Japanese, to the language of the user - first starting with English as the most widely spoken language of the international fan-base.

## Technologies Used


-   In this project I used [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) and [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets). 
-   I also made use of the [Bootstrap framework library](https://getbootstrap.com/) to assist in making the site mobile-responsive.
-   [Google Fonts:](https://fonts.google.com/) Google fonts were used to import the 'Nanum Gothic' font into the style.css file which is used on all pages throughout the project.
-   [Font Awesome:](https://fontawesome.com/) Font Awesome was used on all pages throughout the website to add icons for aesthetic and UX purposes.
-   [GitHub:](https://github.com/) GitHub is used to store the projects code after being pushed from Git.
-   [Git:](https://git-scm.com/) Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.
-   [Responsinator:](http://www.responsinator.com/) Responsinator was used to check the site was responsive across all devices.
-   [Balsamiq:](https://balsamiq.com/) Balsamiq was used to create the wireframes during the design process.
-   Chrome browser & Microsoft Edge.

-   JQuery - The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

## Testing

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

-   [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) - [Results - Home Page](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea), [Gallery Page](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea) & [Upcoming Shows Page](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea).

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly. As the mouse hovers over the page link a red underline appears to show the user what option they would be clicking on, the active page remains underlined so that a uder can always tell from looking at the nav bar what page they are currently on.

At the bottom of each page is a footer with links to social media and merchandise, which are clearly demonstrated using FontAwesome icons that are clear and accepted by users. There is also a 'Return to Top' option, which takes users to the top of whatever page they are on without the need of scolling up for added convenience. As the mouse hovers over each icon the colour changes from dark red to white, to highlight the link and make it clear to users that the icon does something when clicked.

- #### Existing fan visitor goals
    1. As an existing fan of the band, I want to learn more about the band's history and members, so that I will understand where they come from and how they formed.
        -   Upon entering the site users are greeted with the hero image and then underneath is a clear section for the history of the band and underneath that information on the band members. The information is clear and to the point.
    2. As an existing fan of the band, I want it to be easy to visit the band's official website and merchandise store to buy their products. I also want to locate their social media links to see their pages.
        -   The links to the band's website, merchandise and social media are on the footer of every page, the links open in a separate browser window making it easy for users to visit these external sites and still return to the website.
    3. As an existing fan of the band, I want to see where they are next performing and be able to sign-up for more information
        -   The nav bar on every page has a clear link to upcoming shows, that page is clearly laid-out with dates and locations of shows. Underneath the show dates is a simple sign-up form, which confirms when the user enteres the correct information.

- #### Potential fan visitor goals

    1. As a potential fan of the band, I want to see examples of the band's music and see their pictures over the years, so I can see if I like their music and follow them.
        -   The nav bar on every page has a clear link to the gallery page, which contains photos of the band from 2011-2019 so the users can see them growing up over the years. Also there are music videos embedded into the page featuring some of the band's songs, to give the users an experience of their music. The videos contain some official music videos and some from live shows, which gives users a chance to see the band's full performing range.
    2. As a potenital fan of the band, I also want to see where they are performing next and sign-up for more information, so that I can go to see one of their shows live.
        -   As with the existing fan section, the nav bar on every page has a clear link to upcoming shows, whcih contains the dates/locations and a simple sign-up form.

- #### Site owner goals
    1. As a site owner, I want the band to contiune growing in success and therefore want to provide information about them and their upcoming shows to give both existing and potential fans more information about them.
        -   The band's history and band-member information are clear for all to read. The nav bar makes moving between the pages and learning more information about the band and their upcoming shows easy.
    2. As a site owner, I want the band to sell more of their music and merchandise and advertise their upcoming shows. 
        -   The footer on each page has a clear link to the band's UK merchandise store, which opens in another browser window for the user's convenience.
    3. As a site owner, as the band's audience is becoming more global, I wish them wish to reach a wider international fan-base.
        -   The site is created entirely using English (as it is the most spoken language of the band's international fanbase outside of their native Japan). This is so all users/fans of the band, who can speak or read English, will be able to navigate the site and learn more about the band and their shows. Eventually a feature that would be nice to add is a way to translate the content for other languages, to increase the global influence of the band.

### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and FireFox browsers to check it loaded correctly.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7 Plus & Android phones to check it loaded correctly.
-   The website was tested on Responsinator to ensure responsiveness on all devices.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly and the external links worked. This was done by frequently moving from one page to another and clicking the external links for all pages on all devices.
-   All videos were extensively tested to check they played only when clicked on by the user, and that they played the correct content whatever device size or type.
-   The spotify playlist was tested to ensure it only played when clicked by the user, and that it played successfully on all device sizes and types.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues, they reported a success on all fronts.
